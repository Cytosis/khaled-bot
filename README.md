# khaled-bot

This is a very silly Reddit bot designed to simulate a conversation with the one and only DJ Khaled.

See [this video](https://youtu.be/17B9NGk1LHI?t=24s) if you don't understand the context.

There's a writeup of what this is and how it's made [on my blog](http://joelotter.com/2015/04/01/dj-khaled-reddit-bot.html).
